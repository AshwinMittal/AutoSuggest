AutoSuggest
===========

Simple php &amp; js based auto-suggest

||----This is a Simple Auto-Suggest Demo----||

Here I am making use Country-State example where after selecting the Country from drop-down you'll get its corresponding states when you start typing in the State textbox


--CSS--
If you want to change the text & Background colors, you would need changes in css/style.ccs & includes/conect.php


Play around
Cheers!
